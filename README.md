### Using these translations

In order to use these translations, pick the desired language file inside the folder matching your version of Shopkeepers and follow the [instructions in the corresponding wiki page](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki/Translations#using-custom-translations).

### Contributing

With every update of Shopkeepers (if there have been changes to the messages) a new folder is created containing the default translations (english, and likely german since I speak that myself), as well a `changelog` file listing the message changes of that version.

To really be of use **this repository depends on contributions** for languages other than these defaults. Feel encouraged to add new translations, update outdated translations, or suggest changes of existing translations.

Simply fork the project, add or edit a file, and then [create a `Pull Request`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). You can [add and edit files directly on github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-files-on-github) inside the browser (no need to know Git commands!). Github will automatically fork the repository and create a Pull Request for your changes.

To get your changes approved **try to follow these principles**:
* Prefer creating multiple Pull Requests for independent changes (eg. adding or making changes in different translations, or for different versions). On Github you can [create different `Branches`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository), which allows you to keep each of your independent changes separate.
* Stick to the default coloring and formatting scheme of the messages, and of the language file itself.
* Don't include author or server names, advertisements, or links.
* When updating a translation, first copy the old language file into the new version's folder and apply your changes there. The old language file for the previous version has to stay intact.
* You may also suggest changes or alternatives for the default translations, but please include some reasoning on why you think that these changes are required. These changes are then either considered for the next version of Shopkeepers, or added as an alternative translation for one of the default languages.
* When adding new files, use UTF8 encoding. For example, the text editor [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) allows you to easily determine and change the encoding of your file. Try to use UTF8 right from the beginning, because changing the file encoding in retrospect might break special characters.
