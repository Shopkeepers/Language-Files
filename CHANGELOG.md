* msg-button-rabbit-variant

* msg-cant-trade-with-own-shop
* msg-cant-trade-with-shop-missing-chest

### Changed messages

* Renamed 'msg-removed-player-shops' to 'msg-removed-shops-of-player'.
* Renamed 'msg-removed-all-player-shops' to 'msg-removed-player-shops'.
* Renamed 'msg-confirm-remove-admin-shops' to 'msg-confirm-remove-all-admin-shops'.
* Renamed 'msg-confirm-remove-own-shops' to 'msg-confirm-remove-all-own-shops'.
* Renamed 'msg-confirm-remove-player-shops' to 'msg-confirm-remove-all-shops-of-player'.
* The 'msg-removed-player-shops' message (previously 'msg-removed-all-player-shops') no longer mentions that 'all' shops got deleted (since this is not necessarily true).
* Changed the 'msg-button-villager-level' and 'msg-button-villager-level-lore' messages to clarify that this option only changes the visual appearance of the villager's badge color. The included german translation has been updated accordingly as well.
* Slightly changed the german translation of the 'msg-cant-trade-while-owner-online' message.
* Removed the note about left and right clicking items to adjust amounts from the 'msg-trade-setup-desc-admin-regular' message, since this doesn't actually apply to admin shops.

### Changed messages

* msg-list-shops-entry: 'object type' changed to 'object', and the arguments '{shopSessionId}' and '{shopId}' changed to '{shopId}' and '{shopUUID}' respectively. Argument '{shopSessionId}' still works but will likely get removed in the future.
* msg-villager-for-hire: The german translation was slightly changed.

### Removed messages

* The default german translation contained a few no longer used messages: msg-button-type and msg-button-type-lore
